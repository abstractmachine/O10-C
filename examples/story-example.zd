You spend a rather long time together, Saschi teaching you how to wield correctly your sword, how to swing it, how to focus despite of the dog barks and more… In the end of the training, you feel exhausted. "Very good, young one", says the frog. "I am rather impressed. Now for the final step. If you want to use my special technique, you need to hold your sword tight and shout *Dragon Blade* !" You feel confused. "Yes, young one. The shouting is very important, you see. I gives you strength and confidence when you most need it. Now, I must take my leave. It has been a pleasure, young one.

? candles lit
+ « Qu’elles vendent des grimoires sur Etsy, postent des photos de leur autel orné de cristaux sur Instagram ou se rassemblent pour jeter des sorts à Donald Trump, les sorcières sont partout. Davantage encore queleurs aînées des années 1970, les féministes actuelles semblent hantées par cette figure. La sorcière est à la fois la victime absolue, celle pourqui on réclame justice, et la rebelle obstinée, insaisissable. Mais qui étaient au juste celles qui, dans l’Europe de la Renaissance, ont été accusées de sorcellerie ? Quels types de femme ces siècles de terreur ont-ils censurés, éliminés, réprimés ? Ce livre en explore trois et examine ce qu’il en reste aujourd’hui, dans nos préjugés et nos représentations : la femme indépendante – puisque les veuves et les célibataires furent particulièrement visées ; la femme sans enfant – puisque l’époque des chasses a marqué la fin de la tolérance pour celles qui prétendaient contrôler leur fécondité ; et la femme âgée – devenue, et restée depuis, un objet d’horreur. Enfin, il sera aussi question de la vision du monde que la traque des sorcières aservi à promouvoir, du rapport guerrier qui s’est développé alors tant à l’égard des femmes que de la nature : une double malédiction qui reste à lever. »

Believing that the earth was the only world, that it was a vast circular plane, and that it was the fixed and immovable center around which revolved the celestial luminaries, the ancient Astronomers, in conformity to the requirement of the doctrine of future rewards and punishments, as inculcated in the Egyptian Version of the Exoteric Creed, divided it into an upper and an under, or nether world, which they connected by a sinuous and tenebrious passage. »*

The azure dome, called the firmament in the book of Genesis, was believed to be a solid transparency, which we find described, in the fourth chapter and sixth verse, of that collection of Astronomical Allegories, called the Apocalypse, or Book of Revelation, “as a sea of glass like unto crystal.” It was represented as being supported by four pillars, resting upon the earth, one at each of the cardinal points, which were designated as “the pillars of heaven.” Conceiving the idea that there were windows in the firmament, the ancient Astronomers called them “the windows of heaven” and taught that they were opened when it rained, and closed when it ceased to rain. Hence it is evident that the ancient Astronomers did not refer to these pillars and windows in a figurative sense, but as real appurtenances to a solid firmament, as will be seen by reference to Gen. VII. 11, and VIII. 2, Job XXVI. 11, and Malachi III. 10.»*

Believing that the stars were but mere flambeaux, suspended beneath the firmament, and revolving round the earth, for the sole purpose of giving it light and heat; and observing that seven of these, answering to the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, had perceptible movements, in relation to the other luminaries, the ancient astronomers designated them as planets or wandering stars.»*

Perceiving that the other celestial luminaries maintained the same relation to each other, and designating them as fixed stars, the ancient astronomers grouped those visible to them into forty−eight Constellations; and giving names to these, they also attached names to the stars of larger magnitude, which was done for the purpose of locating and distinguishing them with greater ease.»*

Through twelve of these Constellations, mostly contained within a belt of 16 degrees in width, and within which the planets appeared to revolve, the ancient astronomers inscribed a central line representing the Ecliptic, or apparent orbit of the sun, which they divided into 360 degrees; and quartering these to denote the seasons, they named the cardinal points the Summer and Winter Solstices, and the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes; the former referring to the longest and shortest days of the year; and the latter to the two periods when the days and nights are equal. An abbreviatory sign having been attached to each of these constellations, the great celestial belt containing them was called “the wheel of the signs,” or “a wheel in the middle of awheel,” as designated by that old Astrologer, Ezekiel the Prophet, in chap. I. and 16th verse. But for the reason that, with only one exception, the forms of living things, either real or mythical, were given to them, this belt, ultimately, wad designated as the Zodiac; or Circle of living Creatures, see Ezekiel, chap. I. »*

? candles lit
+ *« The Elixir of Life, which was generally described as a solution of the Stone in spirits of wine, or identified with the Stone itself, could be applied, so it was thought, under certain conditions to the alchemist himself, with an entirely analogous result, i.e., it would restore him to the flower of youth. The idea, not infrequently attributed to the alchemists, that the Elixir would endow one with a life of endless duration on the material plane is not in strict accord with alchemistic analogy. From this point of view, the effect of the Elixir is physiological perfection, which, although ensuring long life, is not equivalent to endless life on the material plane. "The Philosopher's Stone," says Paracelsus, "purges the whole body of man, and cleanses it from all impurities by the introduction of new and more youthful forces which it joins to the nature of man." And in another work expressive of the opinions of the same alchmist, we read "… there is nothing which might deliver the mortal body from death; but there is One Thing which may postpone decay, renew youth, and prolong short human life…" In the theory that a solution of the Philosopher's Stone (which, it must be remembered, was thought to be a species with gold) constituted the Elixir Vitæ, can be traced, perhaps, the idea that gold in a potable form was a veritable cure-all: in the latter days of Alchemy any yellow-coloured liquid was foisted upan a credulous public as a medicinal preparation of gold. »*
